# MediSupport Backend APIs

## Project Description

In our fast-paced contemporary era, the scarcity of time has become a significant challenge adversely affecting individual health. The repercussions include disruptions in regular doctor consultations and the progression of minor health issues into severe conditions. Recognizing the pivotal role of timely intervention and preventive measures, we have embarked on the development of the groundbreaking “MediSupport” project.

"MediSupport" is an innovative healthcare and health tracking application and website meticulously designed to provide users with a comprehensive suite of essential health management and tracking resources. The primary aim of this project is to empower individuals to proactively manage their health, leveraging technology to overcome the barriers posed by time constraints and geographical limitations.

Our solution addresses the prevalent difficulty of reaching healthcare professionals, especially in remote areas, and acknowledges the challenges associated with traditional paper-based health tracking methods. "MediSupport" stands as a holistic platform that not only monitors and manages health indicators but also acts as a supportive companion, offering timely medical assistance, a repository of disease-related information, and access to expert medical advice.

In this endeavor, our focus is on harnessing the capabilities of contemporary technology to elevate the user's quality of life with a particular emphasis on healthcare management. "MediSupport" facilitates direct and seamless interactions with specialists across diverse medical domains, bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers. Moreover, we leverage the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance transparency and user-friendliness in the health journey.

### Primary Objectives
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Employ sophisticated algorithms and medical data to predict and prevent heart diseases, enabling early intervention and reducing the risks associated with cardiac issues.
- **Health Monitoring**: Offer users the capability to record and visualize their blood pressure and sugar measurements. These measurements are converted into informative graphs, providing users with the ability to track their health trends and make data-driven decisions.
- **Doctor Booking and Reviews**: Facilitate the process of finding and booking specialist doctors. Additionally, users can review a doctor by rating them, enhancing their ability to make informed choices regarding their healthcare providers.
- **Doctor-Patient Communication**: Establish seamless communication channels between healthcare providers and patients, fostering improved care management and timely consultations.
- **Remote Medical Examination**: Enable users to conduct medical examinations remotely through video calls. This goal aims to provide a platform for virtual consultations with healthcare professionals, allowing users to receive medical advice, prescriptions, and necessary guidance from their homes to relieve people in remote or distant places.
- **Weight and BMI Calculation**: Calculate and provide users with information on their weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), enabling them to manage their fitness goals more effectively.
- **Personalized Medical Advice**: Offer personalized medical advice based on user health conditions, promoting self-care and a better understanding of individual health requirements.
- **Health Education**: Create a repository of medical and health articles, empowering users to educate themselves and stay informed about the latest health trends and practices.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Utilize cutting-edge PPG technology to calculate heart rate using the phone’s camera, making it convenient and accessible for users to monitor their cardiac health.

With these objectives, “MediSupport” strives to empower individuals to proactively manage their health, enhancing the quality of life and contributing to a healthier society.
